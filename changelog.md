Greetings! Thanks for grading my work~

In Part 5.1: I have made these following changes to the original resume site:

1. Background color change to enhance contrast
2. Added a lot of contents (descriptions, picture) in the middle of the page (about my second project). 
3. Added inline css for the coresponding new materials.

In Part 5.2: I thought Google Analytics would be a good idea so I included it.
The Google tracking tag was installed right below the <head> tag.
It would be a good idea to have this as a third party js as it would be a good idea to:
1. Record and analyze data like Page views, Scrolls, and Outbound clicks to enhance user experience in the future. We can better know which part they like and which part they didn't, and thus imporve the page accordingly.
2. If the employer so happened to view the sources and saw this tag, it would look professional~
3. Last, it can actually record if there has been File downloads. Since the resume is downloadble it on the site, it would be really cheering to see that somebody actually viewed your resume and you are getting noticed!
